## üßô Builder Philosophy

This project supports modular builder environments, rootfs stealth configurations, and static toolchain strategies. Contributions should respect:

- Portability across ARM64, x86_64, and rootless shells
- Compatibility with minimal Linux environments
- Manual build processes that avoid CI/CD or centralized deployment
